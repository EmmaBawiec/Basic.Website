     You may ask yourself- what it this website? Well OBVIOUSLY its an archive of the only correct opinions on pasta as decided by me, a noodle connoisseur. Am I qualified? duh. Am I correct? always. 
    </p>
    <h2>Farfalle</h2>
    <img src="Farfalle.jpg" alt="Photo of the best pasta shape ever also known as Farfalle">
    <p>
     GOATED noodle. Like seriously the best. This noodle goes with everything. Farfalle will take you out to dinner, let you cry on its shoulder, help you move into your new apartment, and so much more. Reliable and perfect for any occasion. 10/10.
    </p>
  <h2>Penne</h2>
  <img src="pene.jpg" alt="Photo of Penne Pasta">
    <p>
      Pretty solid noodle. Overall structurally sound, holds sauce well, and can pair with most dishes with ease. Great on its own or as a side, but lacks the creative vision we all crave. 8/10.
    </p>
  <h2>Rotini</h2>
  <img src="rotini.jpg"  alt= "Photo of rotini Pasta">
    <p>
      Fun. Chaotic. Creative. Whimsy. Not quite as reliable for sauce retention but still a hell of a noodle. 7/10.
    </p>
    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
    <img src="spaghetti.jpg" alt= "Photo of spaghetti Pasta">
    <p>
     This pertains to all of the spaghetti family, including but not limited to; spaghetti rigati, thin spaghetti, angel hair, etc. You just think you're sooooo perfect, dont you? You're mediocre<b><i> at best.</b></i> Sure you may be a classic but you can hardly hold any sauce let alone my attention. Yes you're a traditional noodle, but that doesn't mean you've earned my respect. 3/10.
    </p>
    <h2>Wagon Wheels</h2>
    <img src="wagon wheels.jpg" alt= "Photo of the lovely wagon wheel Pasta">
    <p>
     These noodles are pure nostalgia. These noodles are a "fend for yourself / leftover" dinner at home. Wagon Wheel would call you and pretend ther's an emergecy oif you need an excuse to leave the function. These noodlesmake you wanna call you're mom just to check in and remind her you love her. A classic in  my household. 9/10. 
    </p>
    <h2>Fideo Cut Spaghetti</h2>
    <img src="fideo.webp" alt= "Photo of the worst pasta known to mankind (you know the one)">
    <p>
     Okay, now it's time to get serious. I don't know what geriatric sicko out there decided this abonimnation of a noodle shape had to be thrust upson society, but I want to personally tell them how much I despise them. This pasta is LAZY, BORING, and worst of all IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ON A FORK. Am I supposed to eat it with a spoon? Fork? Knife? Chop Sticks? My hands? Come on now. I'm not a barbarian. Despite the sick irony of these noodles, this monstrocity is continuing to sell. I would rather eat a jean jacket than these noodles. No sauce retention, No pizazz, No respect from me. Fideo Cut spaghetti, count your days. -10000000/10.

    <h2>Lasagne</h2> 
    <img src="lasagna.webp" alt= "Photo of Lasagne Pasta">
    <p>
      Although this may not be a traditionally considered noodle, I still think this is an absolute banger. Eating these in lasanga is lovely and they make for a great pairing, but I am rating this past mainly off of the feeling you get when you eat the extra lasagne biidles after assembling a lasagna and realizing you have extra noodles. Nothing beats the absolute feral feelings this noodle unleashes in my brain, nor the way this noodle scratches my brain. creative, unique, and a overall game changer to snacks for the odd and ferral creature I am. 9/10.
